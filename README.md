# kanacode

A python3 desktop app to help practice hiragana and (in the future) katakana and kanji.


### Current state

Only mode available lets the user enter a romaji transliteration for the hiragana they see on screen, and checks whether it is correct.

### Plans

Plan to add a way practice words which only include some specified kana, a mode to get a romaji word and input kana, and possibly similar modes for both katakana and kanji.
